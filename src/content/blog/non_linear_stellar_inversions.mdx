We present a method for a non-linear asteroseismic inversion suitable for gravity-mode pulsators and apply it to slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars. Our inversion method is based on the iterative improvement of a parameterised static stellar structure model, which in turn is based on constraints from the observed oscillation periods. We present tests to demonstrate that the method is successful in recovering the properties of artificial targets both inside and outside the parameter space. We also present a test of our method on the well-studied SPB star KIC 7760680. We believe that this method is promising for carrying out detailed analyses of observations of SPB and Î³ Dor stars and will provide complementary information to evolutionary models.
