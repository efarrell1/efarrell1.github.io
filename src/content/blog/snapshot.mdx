We introduce SNAPSHOT, a technique to systematically compute stellar structure models in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium based on three structural properties - core mass Mcore, envelope mass Menv, and core composition. This approach allows us to connect these properties of stellar interiors to the luminosity and effective temperature Teff in a more systematic way than with stellar evolution models. We compute core-H burning models with total masses of Mtotal = 8-60 M⊙ and central H mass fractions from 0.70 to 0.05. Using these, we derive an analytical relationship between Mcore, Mtotal, and central H abundance that can be readily used in rapid stellar evolution algorithms. In contrast, core-He burning stars can have a wide range of combinations of Mcore, Menv, and core compositions. We compute core-He burning models with Mcore = 2-9 M⊙, Menv = 0-50 M⊙, and central He mass fractions of 0.50 and 0.01. Models with Mcore/Mtotal from 0.2 to 0.8 have convective envelopes, low Teff and will appear as red supergiants (RSGs). For a given Mcore, they exhibit a small variation in luminosity (0.02 dex) and Teff ( $\sim 400\, \mathrm{K}$ ) over a wide range of Menv ( $\sim$ 2-20 M⊙). This means that it is not possible to derive RSG masses from luminosities and Teff alone. We derive the following relationship between Mcore and the total luminosity of an RSG during core He burning: log Mcore ≃ 0.44log L/L⊙ - 1.38. At Mcore/Mtotal ≈ 0.2, our models exhibit a bistability and jump from an RSG to a BSG structure. Our models with Mcore/Mtotal > 0.8, which correspond to stripped stars produced by mass-loss or binary interaction, show that Teff has a strong dependence on Menv, Mcore, and the core composition. We constrain the mass of one of these stripped stars in a binary system, HD 45166, and find it to be less than its estimated dynamical mass. When a large observational sample of stripped stars becomes available, our results can be used to constrain their Mcore, Menv, mass-loss rates, and the physics of binary interaction.
